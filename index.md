## About me

Hi! This is Yandong Luo, a master student in Computer Science at Georgia Institute of Technology, where I'm advised by Prof. Zhao Ye. I'm broadly interested in Perception and Planning. My current research focuses on CUDA-based motion generation for Loco-manipulation.

Before coming to GaTech, I was working at Tusimple company for L2 and L4 trajectory planning and decision making of autonomous trucks operating in the bustling port of Shanghai, China. I obtained my master's degree at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I conducted research on perception and planning for autonomous vehicles under the supervision of Prof. Bob Norris. I completed my bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engieering at Dongguan University of Technology, where I was advised by Prof. Jianwen Guo. During my undergraduate period, I worked on multi-agent systems.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
